## Building
One day I may come back to make this friendlier to build. For now, you'll need SFML headers and .lib files in C:/SFML-2.4.2/include
and C:/SFML-2.4.2/lib, respectively.

## How to use
* **Left mouse button** to add vertices to the curve.
* **Left and right arrow keys** to change the number of iterations used to generate the curve.
* **Up and down arrow keys** to change the color of the next vertex.
* **Space** to clear the curve and start a new one.
